Letâ€™s compare git push and git pull in Git:

git push:
Purpose: Used to send your local commits to a remote repository.
Action:
You push your local changes (commits) to a remote Git repository.
The remote repository can be on another server or even on your local machine (in a different folder).
Use Case:
When you want to share your changes with others or update a central repository.
Commonly used to update the master branch on a shared repository.
git pull:
Purpose: Used to fetch and merge changes from a remote repository into your local repository.
Action:
Pulls commits from a remote repository and merges them into your current branch (HEAD).
Essentially, it combines git fetch (to retrieve changes) and git merge (to integrate them).
Use Case:
When you want to update your local repository with changes made by others.
Fetches the latest commits from the remote repository and applies them to your working branch.
In summary:

git push: Sends your local commits to a remote repository.
git pull: Retrieves and merges changes from a remote repository into your local branch.
Remember, git push is about sharing your changes, while git pull is about updating your local copy!
